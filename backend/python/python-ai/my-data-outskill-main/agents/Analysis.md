III. Risks

1. Sector-Specific Risks

- High absolute interest expense (₹24,269 crore for FY25) requires continued strong earnings and cash flows.
- Capex intensity: Ongoing investments in digital, retail, and energy transformation require disciplined capital allocation.
- Currency and macro risks: As a major importer/exporter, Reliance is exposed to INR fluctuations and global macroeconomic headwinds.

3. Market/Stock Risks
- Valuation: Trading at a moderate premium, any earnings disappointment or sectoral headwinds could impact stock price.
- Relatively lower dividend yield may not appeal to income-focused investors.
